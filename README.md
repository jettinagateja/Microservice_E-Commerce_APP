**E-commerce microservices application project, enhancing  cloud-native skills in building scalable systems.The project involved using GitHub for source code management and Jenkins to automate the CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployments. Docker was used for containerizing microservices, while Kubernetes (EKS) handled orchestration and scaling. AWS services like EKS and EC2 provided the flexibility and scalability for managing the cloud infrastructure. Tools such as kubectl and eksctl were utilized for managing Kubernetes clusters, and IAM ensured secure, fine-grained access control across the environment.**
